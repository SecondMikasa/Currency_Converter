Tried to create a Real Time Currency Converter react + vite app utilizing the different react hooks and react fibre
Implemented Tailiwind CSS to customize the website and make it responsive 
Also implemented a custom react hook for the smooth working of the app

This app was created utilizing the default template provided which forces out a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## How To Use
- Download the code as zip file or clone the repository using git
- Use command cd to open the local project on the ide terminal
- Push `npm install or npm ` to install the neccessary modules for proper functioning of the app
- Also input `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` and `npx tailwindcss init -p` to install Tailwind Libraries
- Type `npm run dev` to initialize and run the app
